# Prompt

Focus on AI/ML developments. Look for:
- New model releases and benchmarks
- Product launches and major updates
- Research paper announcements
- Open source releases
- Industry partnerships and acquisitions
- Policy and regulation news
- Notable technical insights or debates

Ignore: personal life updates, memes, engagement bait, promotional fluff, unrelated topics.
Prioritize tweets with high engagement and those announcing something new.
